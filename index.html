         Having served for six years, including three years representing Portugal in the NATO HQ and European Military
          Committee based in Belgium, I have cultivated valuable qualities such as discipline, teamwork, and adaptability.</p>
      <p>Seeking a fresh career path, I committed myself to the Le Wagon 9-week Web Development bootcamp, where I
        acquired a solid foundation and practical experience in various web development technologies. I am proficient
        in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Ruby on Rails. Additionally, I have hands-on experience using
        version control systems like GitHub and deploying web applications on platforms such as Heroku.</p>
      <p>As a junior developer, I understand the importance of continuous learning and thrive in a supportive and
        collaborative environment. I am passionate about problem-solving, creativity, and staying up-to-date with
        the latest industry trends. Contributing to dynamic projects and expanding my expertise in web development excites me.</p>
      <p>With a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and a willingness to learn, I am confident in my ability to
        make positive contributions to any team. I am open to new opportunities and challenges that will allow
        me to grow and enhance my skills as a Junior Full-Stack Web Developer.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://astroride.herokuapp.com/" class="text-decoration-none text-success">AstroRide</a></h3>

      <p>This collaborative endeavor involved a team of four individuals, focused on creating a
        replica of Airbnb's distinctive features, but with a unique twist of renting out spaceships.
        Within this project, users have the capability to both list their own spaceships for rent,
        specifying available dates and prices, as well as rent spaceships from other users for specific dates.
        As a Full-Stack developer, my responsibilities encompassed a diverse range of tasks,
        including proficiency in Rails, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, GitHub, and Heroku.
